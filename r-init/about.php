                                    This is an initiative of His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Katsina State, Rt. Hon. Aminu Bello Masari.
                                    Katsina National Talent Hunt Challenge is first of its kind in Katsina State and Nigeria.
The Objectives of the KTHNC is to offers the golden opportunity for youths to fulfill their dreams. It can be seen as a way to boost self-esteem, confidence and assurance of youths. It offers youths the opportunity to elevate themselves through natural and acquired skills and prevent them from the possibilities of entering lives of crime. Youths get restless all too easily and if left to their machinations, are seen in un-governed areas at odd
times, which breed escalating cases of indiscipline, abuse and crime.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="text-justify mt-3 text-dark">

empowerment using creative and vocational skills.
