                                    Design is key to the course of innovation and creation; thus, a brilliant design can stimulate patronage in both the public and private sectors of the economy thereby enhancing intellectual and business relations.
Furthermore, Katsina like any other state in the federation will like to have its own coat of arm which will serve as a symbol of progress, unity and hospitality.<br/><br/>
In furtherance to the trend of innovations across the globe, KNTHC wants to distinguish itself in the motivation of youth talent through the production of qualitative and highly standardize designs that are applicable in Nigeria, by encouraging originality, design uniqueness and innovativeness in Nigeria.
